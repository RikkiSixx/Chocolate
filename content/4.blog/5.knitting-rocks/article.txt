On a whim, I recently learned to knit. Rather, I *started* to learn to knit. I haven't yet learned how to *stop* knitting - by which I mean that at the moment, I'm unable to turn what I'm doing into anything of use. Even so, it's a new skill and a relaxing one at that.

This morning I stumbled across the '[Rocking Knit "Rocking Knit"](http://designtaxi.com/news/354270/A-Rocking-Chair-That-Knits-You-A-Winter-Hat/)', a project by [ECAL "ECAL"](http://www.ecal.ch/) Industrial Design and Products students Damien Ludi and Colin Peillex for an exhibition entitled "Low-Tech Factory".

The Rocking Knit takes our fond childhood memories of Grandma knitting in her favourite chair and gives it back to us in machine-form. The kinetic energy created by rocking the chair sets the machine in motion, and the result is a cosy knitted beanie. 

What's really great about this is that it takes our instinctive movement from rocking the chair and turns it into something practical. The only effort is popping another roll of yarn on the spindle. 

Knitting just got that bit more relaxing.
