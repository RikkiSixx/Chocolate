content:
I am a passionate designer and developer, living and working in Leeds, Yorkshire. 

Originally an animator, it was while building my portfolio website that I stumbled across CSS (I'd been taught using tables at university - yuck) and straight away I was hooked. I taught myself everything I could and picked the brains of my colleagues.

Now the web is my career, and I wouldn't have it any other way!

Designing and building a site or application that is a joy to use, giving users an experience as close to perfect as possible, gives me huge satisfaction.
