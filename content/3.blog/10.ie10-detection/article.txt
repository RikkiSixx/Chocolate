content:While having some recent compatability issues with Internet Explorer (of course), I stumbled across a real gem in an <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/ie10-css-hacks/" title="IE10 CSS hacks at Impressive Webs">article on IE10 CSS hacks</a>.

**Conditional comments** are frequently used to iron out hiccups in older versions of IE, but IE10 doesn't support this. Sadly, that means that the <a href="http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/" title="Paul Irish's conditional classes">conditional classes that Paul Irish recommends</a> (which are included in the HTML5 Boilerplate) only work up to (and including) IE9.

The following script is ignored by IE6 - IE9 (due to the conditional comment), and then checks for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8ka90k2e%28v=vs.94%29.aspx" title="Conditional compilation">conditional compilation</a>:

<pre class="brush: xml">
<!--[if !IE]><!-->
	<script>  
		if (/*@cc_on!@*/false) { document.documentElement.className+=' ie10'; }  
	</script>
<!--<![endif]-->	
</pre>

This adds <code>class="ie10"</code> to your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, so you can give it a bit of this in your stylesheet:

<pre class="brush: css">
.ie10 .content {
	/* Some lovely styling */
}
</pre>

This does use JavaScript, which some may see as a bad thing, but that hasn't put me off yet.

This small bit of script gets around this limitation.
