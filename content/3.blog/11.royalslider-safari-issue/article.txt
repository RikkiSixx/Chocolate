Using Dmitry Semenov's <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/royalslider-touchenabled-jquery-image-gallery/461126" title="Royalslider">Royalslider</a> recently (I use it regularly; it's fantastic, versatile and definitely worth a look), I noticed that in Safari I was unable to slide my gallery more than once before it locked. This problem occured on iPads too. 

After sliding to the 2nd "page", I was unable to interact with the slider any further; neither the sliding functionality or the content. Even simple banners throughout the site wouldn't work beyond a single slide.

Luckily, I stumbled across a strange little fix for this. The following CSS, while seemingly never read by the browser, fixes the issue.

<pre class="brush: css">
	.rsWebkit3d .rsSlide {
		-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
	}
</pre>
