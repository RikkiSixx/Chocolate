Last night, Sony staged their much-hyped **PlayStation 4** launch event in New York City. But this post isn't about what the console is; this morning I've been reading more about what the console *isn't*.

Controversially, the electronics juggernaut didn't use their big unveiling to unveil the actual hardware. Instead, the assembled press, developers and onlookers were shown the new DualShock 4 controller (complete with touchpad) and given a bunch of information on what the console is capable of. 

But no console.

I woke up this morning to headlines like <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4011228/playstation-4-hardware-not-shown/in/3774815" title="Sony fails to show PlayStation 4 console at PlayStation 4 event" target="_blank">Sony fails to show PlayStation 4 console at PlayStation 4 event</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21529226" title="PlayStation 4 absent from Sony launch event" target="_blank">PlayStation 4 absent from Sony launch event</a>. Twitter and Facebook were filled with posts about the actual console not being shown.

##  See Sony trollin', they hatin'

So have Sony dropped the ball on this one? 

I don't think so; I think Sony are actually the **world's biggest trolls** right now. They know that the experience delivered by the console is more important than looks, but as we can't play it right now we're all salivating over the thought of that first glimpse. A glimpse that never came. 

What was the result? The whole world is talking about the PlayStation 4. **#PS4** and **#PlayStation2013** have both been trending on Twitter all morning. Sony have had their launch even, held back a view of the hardware and can now grab more headlines when they drop that, presumably after a well-timed break. When it comes to marketing, media coverage and getting us all to talk, it could play out brilliantly.

Well played, Sony.

Sony's PS4 launch-event in NYC is over, but controversially there was no sign of the PS4 itself. Have Sony screwed up or are they the biggest trolls in marketing, using our rage to fuel the fires of their publicity?
