I've had a few conversations recently about CSS pre-processors (my life isn't all car chases and crime fighting) and have been dabbling with different things myself. They've definitely changed the way I think about my CSS and, on doing a direct comparison of two very similar projects, using a pre-processor saved me a large chunk of time on the inital build, despite the fact I'm probably using it at a very simple level.

A few people grumbled that they drifted toward LESS (which is also great) or didn't even try a pre-processor, purely because Sass was a pain to set up. As I remember finding it awkward myself, I thought I'd give a quick run-through of what I did.

**NB.** Before I get started, if you don't like the Command Line - and I emphatically don't - you may want to try out <a href="http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/" title="Scout App">Scout App</a> first. Scout runs in a "self-contained Ruby environment" and gives you a UI to manage your Sass projects. In the end, I found this saved me time and effort, but some people do prefer the hands-on approach.

##Installing Ruby

The worst part of setting up Sass is dealing with Ruby and the Command Line. Download the latest <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" title="Ruby Installer">Ruby Installer</a> and let 'er rip, but when you get to the screen below make sure you check *Add Ruby executables to your PATH*.

##Installing Sass using the Command Line

Open up the Command Line: 

Start > Run > type "cmd". 

Once the window opens, type: 

<pre>
	gem install sass
</pre>

After a few moments, the window should look like this:

If you get the message "ruby is not recognized as an internal or external command" instead, Ruby is not installed correctly, so you may want to go back a step.

##Installing Compass

If you want to install <a href="http://compass-style.org/" title="Compass">Compass</a>, keep the Command Line open for a second. Compass is an open-source CSS framework which uses Sass and provides a ton of extra benefits. Type the following in the command line, and give it a few moments to install:

<pre>
	gem install compass
</pre>

**Boosh!** You're installed and good to go! I won't go through the actual commands used to create, watch and navigate projects as that's fairly well documented, but hopefully this will help with the initial set up!
