Another hiccup with RoyalSlider recently. Each slide on a banner was split in two; the left half with a static **background** image and dynamic text, the right half containing a dynamic image with static text **absolutely-positioned** on top. The issue arose with the static text in the right-hand side not appearing while using Safari on a Mac or iOS device.

It turns out this can be fixed by <q cite="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180051/royalslider-html-content-only-appears-on-first-slide-on-ipad">triggering hardware acceleration on your element over slider</q> (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180051/royalslider-html-content-only-appears-on-first-slide-on-ipad?answertab=votes#tab-top" title="RoyalSlider HTML content only appears on first slide on iPad - Stack Overflow">thanks Eric</a>).

I'm not sure why hardware acceleration would affect some text in a slider, but here's the fix:

<pre class="brush: css">
	.yourTextClass {
		-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
		-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
	}
</pre>

And here's a basic version of what I implemented it on:

<pre class="brush: html">
<div id="slider">

	<div class="rsSlide clearfix">
		<div class="dynamic-text left">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- Here's some dynamic text --></span>
		</div>
		<div class="static-text right">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- This is some static text --></span>
		</div>
	</div><!-- /rsSlide -->

	<div class="rsSlide clearfix">
		<div class="dynamic-text left">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- This is some dynamic text --></span>
		</div>
		<div class="static-text right">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- Static text again --></span>
		</div>
	</div><!-- /rsSlide -->

	<div class="rsSlide clearfix">
		<div class="dynamic-text left">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- More of the dynamic text --></span>
		</div>
		<div class="static-text right">
			<span class="yourTextClass"><!-- A little more static text --></span>
		</div>
	</div><!-- /.rsSlide -->

</div><!-- /#slider -->
</pre>
