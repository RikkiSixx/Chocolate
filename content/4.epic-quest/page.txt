After slamming straight into my 30's in late 2013, I've borrowed an idea from Steve Kamb, founder of <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/" title="Nerd Fitness" target="_blank">Nerd Fitness</a> - the <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/epic-quest/" title="Steve Kamb's Epic Quest of Awesome" target="_blank">Epic Quest</a>. 

## The Quest Begins

The idea is pretty simple; first create a starting list of things to achieve over the next few years. With each item crossed off, advance 20% toward the next 'level'. I'll be adding things to the list as I go along, as well as (hopefully) crossing plenty off.

I've done plenty with my life so far, including travelling around the world, swimming with seals in Australia, finishing a food challenge and working on a sci-fi B-movie about a transvestite superhero. But there's always more that I want to do, so I'll be starting this at Level 1.
