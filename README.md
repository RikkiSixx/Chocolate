## Overview
After probably close to four years, I'm finally re-designing my website. Actually I should say I'm finally *rebuilding* my website - I've re-designed it several times, but by the time I get to the build stage I'm already onto a new one!

My previous site design-oriented, hard to update and maintain, used almost no HTML5 or CSS3 and perhaps worst of all, it was as far from mobile-friendly as is possible to be.

In short, it no longer reflected either myself or my skills.  

## Rebuilding

With the redesign essentially done (as it's not client-work I do have a habit of making design tweaks while in the development stage), I knew what lay ahead. My new site would be responsive and revolve around a blog. I knew I did *not* want to use Wordpress; it's a great product, but only for the right project.

Instead, I used the lightweight, database-less CMS Stacey. It's functionality allowed for easy customisation and meant I could create new written articles, display images and even add new sections and pages extremely easily. Using Markdown for the posts, I no longer had to worry about a CMS cocking-up the styling or structure of my content.
