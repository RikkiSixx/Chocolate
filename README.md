## Overview
After probably close to five years, I've finally re-designed my website. Rather than building one site, calling it finished, then tearing it down and doing a new one in a few years, I'll be updating the site slowly over time. Since launch, I've added a side-bar and am working on additional functionality, in addition to design tweaks. 

My previous site was static, awkward to update and maintain, used almost no HTML5 or CSS3, focused solely on my design work and was as far from mobile-friendly as is possible to be.

In short, it no longer reflected either myself or my skills.  

## Rebuilding

With the redesign essentially done (as it's not client-work I do have a habit of making design tweaks while in the development stage), I knew what lay ahead. My new site would be responsive and revolve around a blog. I knew I did *not* want to use Wordpress; it's a great product, but only for the right project.

Instead, I used the lightweight, database-less CMS Stacey. It's functionality allowed for easy customisation and meant I could create new written articles, display images and even add new sections and pages extremely easily. Using Markdown for the posts, I no longer had to worry about a CMS cocking-up the styling or structure of my content.
